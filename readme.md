Linear Equation Visualizer
==========================

I built this tool as a way for my sister in-law to more easily visualize what a line equation will look, as values are changed.

The two dashed circles can be dragged and will automatically snap to whole integer coordinates. Has only been tested on webkit, since the target is iPad.

The equation in the top left corner is the linear equation for the currently displayed line. For performance reasons the equation isn't displayed while dragging any of the points.

Both points can be dragged at the same time.
